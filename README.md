# cs545-teaching
A set of slides and code to help teach enough content to build a valid website for cs545, which makes this essentially an intro to cs546.

Each folder contains a slideshow, and any relevant code/files to that week. Any files are formatted in "slide_name.extension" format, so if a file is named "2_data_types.js" then 2 is the slide it's found on that week, "data_types" is what it's named, and ".js" means its a javascript file.
